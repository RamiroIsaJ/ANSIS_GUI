In directory */src*, you will find an user guide document.

## Run of ANSIS
Ansis could be use in 2 modes: ONLINE (during the biology process) or OFFLINE (analysis of image from a directory). The core of this software is GEMA. GEMA is an algorithm developed and used for image segmentation using a linear regression of cofficient of variation accordding the histogram. 

### Example of ANSIS evolution
